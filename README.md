# Car-Sales-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze car sales and profits for SwiftAuto Traders, a chain of car dealerships. The task involves creating visualizations and presenting them as a dashboard or report to the regional manager. The analysis is divided into two parts, focusing on Excel and dashboard creation using Google's Looker Studio.

## Project Structure

1. **Part 1: Create Visualizations using Excel**
    - Develop several charts to analyze car sales and profits, including bar charts, line charts, and column charts.
    - Save the final workbook as `CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx`.

2. **Part 2: Create Visualizations using IBMâ€™s Cognos Analytics (OR Google's Looker Studio)**
    - Develop a dashboard/report with KPIs, bar charts, column charts, treemaps, heatmaps, and more.
    - Export the final dashboard/report as a PDF.
